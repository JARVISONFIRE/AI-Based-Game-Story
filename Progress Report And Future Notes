Week 1 : March 23, 2025

Roadmap : 
// Game idea and content
// turnTimer - The Turn Timer script counts down the duration for each turn and automatically triggers a turn change when the time expires.
// gameFlowManager - GameFlowManager Responsibilities:
    Track Turns: Maintain a list of players and an index to know whose turn it is.
    Turn Conditions: Decide when a turn ends (time expiry or player action).
    Player Actions: Ensure only the active player’s input is processed.

- Build Support For Other Devices
  - Add Build Support : If you plan to build for Android, iOS, or other platforms, look for an “Add modules” or “Add components” option during installation.This allows you 
    to select Android Build Support, WebGL, etc. If you don’t see it right away, you can add these modules later by clicking the Settings (gear icon) next to the installed 
    Unity version in the Installs tab.
