- Build Support For Other Devices
  - Add Build Support : If you plan to build for Android, iOS, or other platforms, look for an “Add modules” or “Add components” option during installation.This allows you 
    to select Android Build Support, WebGL, etc. If you don’t see it right away, you can add these modules later by clicking the Settings (gear icon) next to the installed 
    Unity version in the Installs tab.
